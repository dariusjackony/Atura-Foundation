<!-- backend and frontend -->
This repository contains the backend and frontend code for the Atura Foundation project. The backend is built using Node.js and Express, while the frontend is developed with React.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Atura Foundation project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/atura-foundation.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd atura-foundation/Backend
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

<!-- 4. Create a `.env` file in the root of the backend directory and add your environment variables:
   ```
   PORT=3000
   ``` -->

5. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../Frontend
   ```

7. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

8. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Now you should have both the backend and frontend servers running. You can access the backend API at `http://localhost:3000` and the frontend application at `http://localhost:3001`.
